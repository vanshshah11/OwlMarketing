# Master Pipeline Orchestration

This script ties together all modules of the project to form a complete, automated pipelineâ€”from ideation to posting.

## Setup

1. **Create the Master Script:**
   - In this directory, create `master_pipeline.py`.
   - This script calls functions from each module in sequence:
     - Content Analysis & Ideation (from `agents/`)
     - Video Generation (from `video_generation/`)
     - Video Editing (from `video_editing/`)
     - Scheduling & Posting (from `scheduling/`)

## How It Works

- **Step-by-Step Workflow:**
  1. **Ideation:** Generate a creative script using the OWL agents.
  2. **Generation:** Convert the script to raw video content.
  3. **Editing:** Process the raw video (crop, add captions/music).
  4. **Posting:** Automatically upload the final video to all configured accounts.
- **Modularity:**  
  Each step is modular and can be tested independently before integration.
- **Execution:**  
  Run the master pipeline with:
  ```bash
  python master_pipeline.py
