# Project Strategy & Roadmap

## Vision

Create an automated system that:
- Analyzes existing video content to generate creative ideas.
- Produces short, engaging videos using AI-generated avatars.
- Edits videos with captions, transitions, and trendy music.
- Automates posting to multiple social media accounts.

## Key Components

1. **Content Analysis & Ideation:**
   - Use a multi-agent framework (OWL/CAMEL-AI) to extract trends and generate creative scripts.
   - Ingest large amounts of existing reels to learn style, tone, and engagement strategies.

2. **Video Generation:**
   - Leverage text-to-video and avatar models to produce raw video content.
   - Fine-tune models (e.g., using DreamBooth/Stable Diffusion) on curated data.
   - Support multiple AI avatars for diversity.

3. **Video Editing & Post-Processing:**
   - Use FFmpeg/MoviePy to automatically crop, resize, add captions, and merge with background music.
   - Ensure caption timing is precise and synchronized with audio.
   - Integrate trendy music via API or curated libraries.

4. **Scheduling & Automated Posting:**
   - Automate multi-account posting using Playwright for browser automation.
   - Manage at least 10 social media accounts simultaneously.
   - Schedule posts for optimal engagement.

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1:** Set up environment, clone repositories, and verify each module independently.
- **Phase 2:** Integrate and fine-tune AI models for content analysis and video generation.
- **Phase 3:** Develop robust video editing scripts to ensure professional-quality output.
- **Phase 4:** Implement and test scheduling & automated posting across multiple accounts.
- **Phase 5:** Iterate based on feedback, optimize for performance, and add new features.

## Goals

- Fully automate content creation and posting.
- Maintain flexibility to adjust avatars, music, and captions.
- Scale to manage multiple accounts with minimal manual intervention.

This document serves as our blueprint for the project. It will be updated as we iterate and add new features.
